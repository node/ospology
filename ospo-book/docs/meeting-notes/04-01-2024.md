### EMEA &APAC Meeting Notes

**Automation tools for OSPOs** 
- tooling that check for license compliance
- A lot of tools that you can use freely but there are also closed tools
- Implementation. How to do things efficiently, and how we automate processes.
- Policies might not work always (people don’t usually follow them) so automation tooling is important. 
- Security automation and reporting (e.g scorecards integration)
Idea: Define day-to-day operations based on the OSPO flower structure (e.g how to work with Business / legal compliance/security)
**Measuring the performance of the activity**
- Measuring the number of contributions that the company has been making to open source projects - something to develop also in chapter 6 (measuring)
Idea: Before brainstorming day-to-day issues, let’s define the *why*. Why is an organization focused on license compliance automation and hiring and setting up an OSPO to track that?
- for instance:  Open source usage = Lack of understanding from developers on how to understand open source licenses. Teaching and giving insights (e.g. if there are license violations, how to fix that).
Idea: divide Chapter 4 into two activities: routine vs yearly strategy
Discussion: Does strategy fit more in Chapter 2 or Chapter 4
- Need to unify Corporate Strategy versus Community Strategy
- It is important to let decision-makers understand the critical importance of supporting open source projects (and its community), foundations, etc
- Strategy is something that affects “daily”. Thus, it might fit in Chapter 4
Tools mentioned:
- OSFF Scorecard https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openssf-scorecard-monitor
- License checker for NPM ecosystem: https://github.com/onebeyond/license-checker

|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Fundamental reasons for OSPOs to focus on this task | Streamline license management to facilitate easier discovery of licenses and minimize the approval processes required from developers when using open source tools. | Enable tools and best practices for integrating security measures, such as scorecards, into daily operations | Inform strategic adjustments and operational enhancements | A unified strategy influences daily operations |
| Perceived Value                     | Automation in license compliance reduces manual oversight, accelerates development workflows, and ensures compliance with open source licenses without burdening developers with lengthy approval processes | Automation in security practices and vulnerabilities exploration in open source projects allows effective risk management. | Measuring performance facilitate transparent assessment of the OSPO's effectiveness | Guiding decisions on contributions to open source projects, engagement with community initiatives, and the balancing of organization and community benefits |
| Using Open Source (Scope)           | Explore automation tools that assist developers in organizations in scanning and identifying open source licenses the can use, and speed up the compliance process. | Explore automation tools that assist developers to self-assess security risk on specific projects, without burdening them with lengthy approval processes | TBD (ping CHAOSS OSPO metrics WG to give input on this) | Enable decision makers understand the critical importance of supporting open source projects (and its community) and foundations, and the different ways to offer support |
| Contributing to Open Source (Scope) | Explore automation tools that assist developers in organizations in scanning and identifying open source licenses to projects they would like to contribute as employees, and speed up the compliance process. | Explore automation tools that assist developers to self-assess security risk on projects they would like to contribute as employees, without burdening them with lengthy approval processes | | frameworks that support strategic planning and execution |

### AMER & EMEA Meeting Notes

- **Manual Support Work:** Involves answering questions on all aspects of open source, including license compliance, selecting open source software, and interactions with vendors. It also includes engaging with the community and partners, securing sponsorships, and organizing open source events.

- **Tooling:** Questions arise about identifying the funding authority responsible for supporting the infrastructure and tooling for license compliance, security, and engineering.

- **Content Creation, Training, and Education:** Crucial to ensure that individuals are qualified to assess projects. Developing training materials and documentation and aiding teams to produce these across different departments are key tasks.

- **Resource Allocation:** Requires a strategic approach to prioritize effectively.

- **Risk Management:** Involves assessing the risks the organization faces. Obtaining a comprehensive view of the organization's tech stack, such as generating SBOMs, and considering software from vendors, legacy software, and proprietary software is crucial. This is more about a business assessment perspective rather than just data gathering. Decisions need to be made on whether to optimize SBOMs or to allocate time to other areas.

- **Sponsoring Open Source Communities and Foundations:** Providing insights into the dynamics and complexities of open source governance and models is part of this.

- **Measuring Technical Debt:** In open source projects requires understanding maturity and governance models.

- **Coordinate with Various Parts of the Organization:** Map interactions with teams based on the OSPO flower diagram, distinguishing between technical questions (engineering) and non-technical questions (business, design team).

- **Discussion:** Yearly strategy to be on chapter 3 (value of the OSPO, or fundamentals) and the monthly strategy (make small updates) - more related to measuring and adjusting the strategy based on the progress has been doing.






| Personalized support / Q&A Sessions | Advocacy and Education | Community Integration | Business Assessment on Risk Management |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Fundamental reasons for OSPOs to focus on this task** | Actively involve employees and managers in open source activity engagement. | Advocating for the importance of education in open source and creating resources to support it | Integrate organization's activities effectively with the open source projects and foundations (financial as well as resource support) as well as community dynamics. Map interactions with technical (engineering) versus non-technical teams (business, design team) | Assess risks that the organization is facing, including an overview of the tech stack |
| **Perceived Value** | Increase and improve open source knowledge and expertise across the organization's teams. | Ensure that people are qualified to judge a project (governance models, maturity, etc) and measure the technical debt on an open source project | Allocate effective financial and resource support to critical open source projects that organization's employees use/engages | Assistance in evaluating which open source projects to use and how to prioritize resources effectively |
| **Using Open Source (Scope)** | Answering questions on everything about open source, including license compliance, selecting open source software, and dealing with vendors | Build training and documentation, and assist teams in creating these materials across different teams | How to get sponsorship, run open source events, and integrate effectively with the open source community and its foundations. | E.g.) business assessment to determine whether optimizing SBOMs or focusing on other areas is more beneficial.
