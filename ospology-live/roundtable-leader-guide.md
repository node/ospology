As a leader of one of OSPOlogylive roundtable sessions, you play a pivotal role in facilitating open forum discussions that light the way for solving common challenges within the field. 
This document is designed to guide you through the process and ensure that your session is both productive and enriching for all participants.

## Overview
Roundtables at OSPOlogyLive are collaborative sessions for participants to share best practices, explore solutions, and collectively address obstacles. 
These sessions highlight the importance of community-driven dialogue in illuminating diverse perspectives and wisdom.

## Your Role as a Leader
As the leader of a roundtable session, you will:
* Initiate Discussion: Start the session with an initial topic of discussion that is relevant for the participants.
* Facilitate Introductions: Allow time for brief introductions by each participant, fostering a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere.
* Assign Roles: Appoint a scribe to take summary notes of the discussion, ensuring these notes capture the essence of the conversation without compromising participant anonymity, unless they allow to do so.
* Guide the Dialogue: Encourage an open, respectful exchange of ideas, ensuring all voices are heard and considered.
* Ensure Antitrust Policy Awareness: Ensure that all participants are aware of and comply with the [Linux Foundation's Antitrust Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/antitrust-policy). 
* Conclude with Actionable Insights: Ensure the discussion wraps up with concrete next steps or recommendations that can be shared with the wider community.

## Documentation and Sharing
* Anonymity and Inclusivity: All sessions follow [Chatham House Rules](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule). Notes must be taken to preserve the anonymity of participants unless they allow to disclose their name and/or affiliation in the document.
* Note-Taking: The scribe will produce summary notes that encapsulate key points, insights, and proposed next steps or recommendations.
* Submission to the Repository: As a leader, you are responsible for ensuring that the session's summary notes are submitted to the [OSPOlogy repo Discussions](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions) and are linked to the repo where the [OSPOlogyLive edition](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/ospology-live) resources live.
By doing this submission, we ensure that the content complies with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY 4.0) license.
* Open Access: By sharing these notes under the CC-BY 4.0 license, we ensure that the knowledge generated during the session is freely available for the broader community to benefit from, reuse, and build upon.

## Best Practices for Leading a Roundtable
* Prepare: Familiarize yourself with the topic and think about key questions or challenges to present to the group.
* Engage Participants: Encourage everyone to contribute and share their experiences or viewpoints.
* Manage Time: Keep the discussion on track and within the allotted time, ensuring there's room for introductions, discussion, and conclusion.
