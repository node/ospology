## About OSPOlogyLive

OSPOlogy Live is a series of conferences designed as interactive lectures and breakout rooms that aim to connect open source program office (OSPO) professionals from both local and international spheres. The events facilitate the exchange of knowledge and information on existing projects within open source communities, as well as provide a platform to discuss emerging trends and collaborate on best practices in OSPOs tailored to the specific needs of each region.

* Current efforts are being done in Europe, with the aim to expand to other countries in upcoming years.

## Problem statement

Due to the wide range of responsibilities and ways to operate, OSPO professionals usually find it difficult when it comes to implement open source best practices, policies, processes, or tools to integrate open source operations as part of their  organization's IT strategy and tech stack.

## OSPOlogyLive Framework

We are introducing a new framework for hybrid, small-scale mini-summit targeted to discuss important topics for OSPOs based on specific region needs. This format provides a more intimate and interactive setting for participants to engage in discussions, share knowledge, and build relationships with like-minded professionals.

This way, people can talk openly about their organization's open source challenges and work together on shared solutions. Topics range from safely using open source to license compliance, sustainability, contributing back to the community, and more. For the full list of OSPO-specific topics please see [https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/).

In a nutshell, the framework defines the following small-scale conference:

- Follows an unconference style meaning it's a participants-driven meeting
- Aim is to share openly and learn from each other under Chatham House Rules and connect OSPOs with various open source communities involved in the open source activities that matter to them (e.g. os policies, tooling, standards, and community building)
- It is a 2-day in-person event, part prepared presentations, part hands-on workshop, and of course, there is space for networking.
- Follows Linux Foundation antitrust policies and code of conduct
- Participants can register their interest to receive an invite via [Linux Foundation's community platform](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/ospology-european-chapter/) as seats are limited.
- Location is to be provided by one of the participants (host) for free
- Each participant pays for their own food, travel, and lodging. Lunch and dinners may be free if workshop organizers find sponsors.
- Linux Foundation, TODO group can help with promoting the workshops via various communication channels (social media, mailing lists, newsletters, etc.).

### Unconference and Featured Roundtable Sessions

Roundtables are a format of open forum discussions designed to illuminate common questions and challenges in a particular field. They serve as a collaborative platform where participants can come together to explore solutions, share best practices, and collectively overcome obstacles. In these sessions, the meeting notes are taken to ensure anonymity. These notes are then shared in the OSPOlogyLive repository under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY 4.0) license, ensuring that the knowledge and ideas developed are freely available for everyone to reuse and build upon.

Roundtable sessions are led by community participants. These sessions are divided into two categories: Featured Roundtable Sessions and Unconference Roundtables. Featured Roundtable Sessions are pre-defined topics. In the unconference Roundtables, the topics for these sessions are elected by the attendees on the same day, allowing for the exploration of current and emerging issues that are most relevant to the participants.

### Suggested Agenda Sections

Every OSPOlogyLive is slightly different bassed on the micro-conference theme and region needs. However, these are some common areas that a OSPOlogy host and organizers can start discussing when defining an OSPOlogy Live session:

* OSPO Use Cases: This section will consist of expert-led panels or talks that share experiences and case studies from specific OSPOs. The aim is to provide insights and inspiration from successful OSPOs to help others improve their own programs.

* Project Activity Trends: This section will highlight specific activities within [INSERT PROJECT NAME], such as outcomes of recent open soruce community & project activities. The aim is to give people insights into various topics the communities are working on that help in OSPO day-today-operations and/or adoption and gather feedback and contributions from the audience.

* Shared Challenges Assessment: In this section, we will identify shared challenges and pain points on the OSPO mind map, and let the audience vote for the areas of interest to form working groups. The focus areas can be specific activities within OSPO responsibilities, and the goal is to encourage collaboration and problem-solving.

* Breakout Sessions: During the breakout sessions, participants will define goals and identify pain points related to their chosen focus area. Each breakout group aims to capture their challenges and document their experiences and solutions if possible, to share with the wider OSPO community.

* Networking / Social 

## Key actors, Host selection criteria and requirements

### Key actors description

OSPOlogy Live involves two key actors: the organizing team and the venue host. 

* **The organizing team** is responsible for planning and executing the micro-conference, including setting the agenda, finding speakers, and managing logistics. The team is coordinated by Ana and Thomas.

* **The venue host,** on the other hand, provides the physical location for the event and sponsors the cost of the venue. The host is an integral part of the organizing team, working closely with the team to ensure the micro-conference runs smoothly.

It's worth noting that the organizing team and the venue host may be the same entity or individual, depending on the circumstances.

### How host selection criteria works

To ensure that the event meets our project direction and values, we require a formal proposal (email sent to organizers) from potential hosts. Please review the following requirements and recommendations when submitting your proposal:

* Your organizations is an active Open Source Contributor: Hosts must be actively contributing to open source projects to be eligible for consideration.

* Size and Industry Diversity: We are looking for hosts that represent a diverse range of organizaiton sizes (small, medium and large) and industries to provide a well-rounded perspective on open source.

* OSPO Preferred Choice: Hosts with an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) are preferred because they demonstrate a commitment to adopting a holistic approach to open source within the organization, encompassing security, community health, compliance, culture, as well as how to effectively integrate open source as part of the organization's IT Strategy and Tech Stack

* Easy Accessibility: Hosts should be located in an easily accessible location to ensure that attendees can travel to and from the event with ease.

### Aproval Process

**1) An organization contacts the [OSPOlogy Live organizing team](mailto:ospologylive-organizers@lists.todogroup.org) to host:** Provides a first idea of the topics they would like to focus, specific region and available days. This is notified to the rest of organizers for awareness and approval.

### Recommendations:

* Record Presentations: We highly recommend that hosts allow set up to record presentations to allow for hybrid formats and make the content accessible to a broader audience.

The organizing committee will review all proposals to ensure that they fit within the project direction and values. We reserve the right to have the final word on selecting a host for OSPOlogyLive.

## Responsibilities

The OSPOlogy Live organizing team is responsible for a variety of tasks, including:

* Requests: Reviewing and approving/declining workshop requests submitted by potential presenters. All voting is conducted via a two-thirds majority of OSPOlogy Live organizers. In the event of conflict resolution, the TODO Steering Committee will have final oversight of the proposed workshop.

* Venue Host: Identifying and coordinating with the OSPOlogy host to secure a meeting room for the event.

* Oversee Logistics: Despite OSPOlogy Host are responsible of the conferenc elogistics, OSPOlogy Live Organizers should Oversee these logistical aspects in case there are some issues related to scheduling, audio/visual equipment, catering, and registration.

## FAQ

**1️⃣ How many OSPOlogyLive micro-conferences happens every year?**

We hold a maximum number of 3-4 OSPOlogyLive micro-conferences per year in various European countries, each focusing on specific OSPO responsibilities.

**2️⃣ Can I host multiple OSPOlogyLive micro-conferences in the same country?**

We value location diversity and aim to provide opportunities for different regions to host OSPOlogyLive micro-conferences that cater to their specific needs. As a result, **we do not plan to organize multiple OSPOlogyLive events in the same region during the same year.**

However, one of the goals of OSPOlogyLive is to encourage the growth of local OSPO communities (and encourage native-language), led by local ambassadors. We believe that local OSPO meetups, powered by the TODO Group, can provide valuable opportunities for networking, learning, and collaboration among open source enthusiasts in a specific area.

If you're interested in becoming a local OSPO ambassador or organizing an OSPO meet-up, please check out OSPO Local Meetups [Framework](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/local-meetups/framework.md) and [local host guidelines](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/local-meetups/local-host-guidelines.md) for more information on how you can get involved.b Current OSPO Local Meetups includes OSPO Local Chapter Finland, Netherlands and Japan.
