## ðŸŽ™ OSPOlogyLive Speaker Guide

To ensure your panel discussion or presentation runs smoothly, we've compiled this guide with essential information about the setup and logistics.

## AV Equipment and Room Configuration

* Microphones: There will be handheld microphones available for panelists, speakers, and audience.
* Seating: In case the presentation is a panel, there will be 5 seats arranged for speakers.
* Laptop Requirement: Attendees must bring their own laptops. While an HDMI adapter will be provided, bringing your own is recommended for compatibility.
* HDMI Connection: An adapter will be provided, but you are encouraged to bring your own if you have specific requirements.

## Presentation Guidelines

* Slides Design: You are free to use your own slide design. If needed, the [OSPOlogy logo](https://github.com/todogroup/artwork?tab=readme-ov-file#ospology-logos) is available in color and monochrome style to include in your presentation materials.
* Slide Submission: Presentation slides should be uploaded in advance via [OSPO Forum (new discussion)](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions). This link will be later be stored into the [OSPOlogyLive Knowledge Archive](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/ospology-live/2024-february-apeldoorn), a
document located in the OSPOlogyLive Repository. This allows attendees to access the slides before and after the event.

## Additional Information

Speakers can arrive earlier than 09:00 to settle in or prepare for the day. To facilitate a smooth transition between presentations, we recommend testing your 
laptop's connection to the HDMI switch and the provided adapter upon arrival.
